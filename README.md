## Information for use and installation

### Installation 
Clone repo, install dependencies, and create a member account.

### Usage 
Life Point is here to assist users in helping manage their mental health in a format inspired by bullet journaling. Each time users login and head to “Daily Entry” they are greeted with a positive daily affirmation. From here users can keep tabs on their mood, whether or not they took their medication, hours slept, minutes of exercise, minutes napping, caffeine and alcohol servings, hours spent on digital media, and minutes spent socializing. Along with a simple checklist of the basic activities such as showering, brushing teeth and self care. A checklist of ailments is listed as well along with an appetite meter for monitoring. 
 
Users are also prompted to write a list of what they are grateful for as well as a list of reminders. Furthermore, users are encouraged to fill in a journal entry to further elaborate their emotions for the day. Entries are saved, and can be accessed via the calendar page to look back upon. 
 
Mental health resources are also provided if users feel they need additional support.
